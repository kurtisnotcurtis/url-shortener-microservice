# URL Shortener Service

This webapp provides basic API functionality to accept a URL (either as a URL parameter or POST request query) and generate a shorter URL that redirects to the provided URL. 

This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's Backend curriculum as the fourth API project (non-beta curriculum, as of 7/19/2017). [Click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice) to find out more.

## Usage

Via URL parameter:

Via the site form:
